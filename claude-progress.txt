## Session 42 - 2026-02-09

### Completed Features:
- Feature #140: Theme state syncs across tabs ✅

### Verification Details:
- Feature #140: Theme state syncs across tabs
  - Added `window.addEventListener('storage', ...)` in ThemeContext.jsx
  - Listens for changes to `theme_preference` key in localStorage
  - When another tab updates localStorage, the storage event fires and updates theme state
  - Test flow:
    1. Tab 1 and Tab 2 both in light mode (no theme_preference in localStorage)
    2. Click dark mode toggle in Tab 1 → dark mode applied, localStorage set to 'dark'
    3. Switch to Tab 2 and refresh → Tab 2 loads in dark mode ✅
    4. Toggle button shows "Cambiar a modo claro" / "Modo claro" confirming dark mode ✅
    5. Cross-tab storage event also observed firing when Tab 2's localStorage was changed
  - No mock data patterns in ThemeContext.jsx
  - Verified via Playwright browser automation with screenshots

### Changes Made:
- frontend/src/lib/ThemeContext.jsx: Added storage event listener useEffect for cross-tab theme sync

### Current Status: 137/265 features passing (~51.7%)

### What should be worked on next:
- More State & Persistence features
- UI/UX improvements
- Remaining security/access control features

  - Created new notification via API (presidente creates for delegado)
  - After 30s poll, badge auto-updated from 12 → 13
  - Navigated to Notificaciones page, new notification visible at top
  - Marked as read, badge decreased from 13 → 12 immediately
  - Custom event 'notifications-updated' dispatched to sync sidebar
  - Zero console errors, no mock data patterns

- Feature #128: Reminder notification after 3 days
  - Created scheduler.js module with checkPendingReminders()
  - Queries payment_requests with status='pendiente' and updated_at > 3 days ago
  - Creates 'recordatorio' type notifications for all active presidentes
  - Prevents duplicate reminders (checks if already reminded within 3 days)
  - Scheduler starts on server boot + runs every hour via setInterval
  - Graceful shutdown stops scheduler interval
  - Test: Created PR #51, simulated 4 days aging via debug endpoint
  - Triggered check, reminder notification #86 created for presidente
  - Verified in UI: 🔔 "Recordatorio: solicitud pendiente" visible
  - Duplicate check: Running again creates 0 new reminders
  - Data persists after full server restart
  - Zero console errors

### Files Created/Modified:
- backend/src/scheduler.js (NEW): Periodic reminder check logic
- backend/src/index.js: Integrated scheduler startup/shutdown
- backend/src/routes/debug-schema.js: Added simulate-age debug endpoint

### Current Status: 130/265 features passing (49.1%)

## Session 40 - 2026-02-09

### Completed Features:
- Feature #134: Sidebar collapse state persists in localStorage ✅
- Feature #135: Pipeline view preference persists ✅
- Feature #136: Filter state resets on page change ✅

### Verification Details:
- Feature #134: Collapsed sidebar, opened new tab - sidebar stayed collapsed.
  Expanded sidebar, closed and reopened tab - sidebar stayed expanded.
  Uses localStorage key 'sidebar_collapsed' in Layout.jsx.

- Feature #135: Switched from Kanban to Table view on Solicitudes (Egresos) page.
  Navigated to Dashboard and back - Table view still selected.
  Full page refresh - Table view still persisted.
  Uses localStorage key 'solicitudes_view' in Solicitudes.jsx.

- Feature #136: Applied category filter ("Donación") and date filter ("2026-02-08") on Ingresos page.
  Navigated to Dashboard via client-side navigation.
  Navigated back to Ingresos - all filters cleared: category back to "Todas las categorías",
  date filters hidden, search empty, showing all 32 records.
  Filters use React useState (not localStorage), so they reset on component unmount/remount.

### Changes Made:
- None - all three features were already implemented. Verification only.

### Current Status: 136/265 features passing (~51.3%)

### What should be worked on next:

## Session 39 - 2026-02-09

### Completed Features:

### Verification Details:
- Feature #131: Opened income creation form, filled fields (Monto, Categoría, Descripción, Pagador),
  refreshed page without submitting. Form modal closed, all fields cleared, zero orphan records in database.
  Forms use pure useState with no auto-save or localStorage persistence - refresh clears everything by design.

- Feature #132: Logged in as presidente, opened second tab to same app.
  Tab 1 on Ingresos, Tab 2 on Egresos (Solicitudes). Both tabs show authenticated state,
  work independently with full data. JWT stored in localStorage is shared across tabs.

- Feature #133: Added storage event listener to AuthContext.jsx.
  When logout happens in Tab 1 (removeToken from localStorage), the storage event fires in Tab 2.
  The listener detects token removal (e.key === 'token' && e.newValue === null) and sets user to null.
  ProtectedRoute then redirects to /login. Verified both tabs redirect to login after logout in one tab.

### Changes Made:
- frontend/src/lib/AuthContext.jsx: Added useEffect with window storage event listener for cross-tab logout

### Current Status: 132/265 features passing (~49.8%)

### What should be worked on next:

  - Backend: requireRole('secretaria') + status check for 'aprobado' on /execute endpoint
  - Frontend: Ejecutar button only shows when canExecute && req.status === 'aprobado'
  - Verified via API tests (test-feature28.js) and Playwright browser automation

- Feature #29: Expired JWT token forces re-login
  - Backend: TokenExpiredError returns 401 from auth middleware
  - Frontend: api.js clears token and redirects to /login on 401

### What was built:
- Backend Express server (Node.js) at port 3001
- SQLite database using sql.js with file-based persistence (backend/data/tapin.db)
- Full database schema with 9 tables matching app_spec.txt:
  - organizations, users, categories, transactions, payment_requests
  - payment_events, attachments, notifications, transaction_audit_log
- All tables have proper foreign keys, NOT NULL constraints, CHECK constraints, and DEFAULT values
- Health endpoint (GET /api/health) with database status
- Auth routes (POST /api/auth/login, GET /api/auth/me, POST /api/auth/refresh)
- Transactions CRUD routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/transactions)
- JWT authentication middleware
- Debug schema endpoint (GET /api/debug/schema) for verification

## Session 3 - 2026-02-08

### Completed Features:
- Feature #11: Login fails with invalid credentials ✅
- Feature #12: User can logout successfully ✅
- Feature #14: JWT session persists across page refreshes ✅

### Changes Made:
- Fixed api.js request() to not intercept 401 on /auth/login endpoint
  - Previously, any 401 would trigger token removal + redirect, preventing the
    login error message from reaching the Login component
  - Now /auth/login 401 responses pass through so "Credenciales inválidas" displays

### Verification Details:
- Feature #11: Login with wrong password shows "Credenciales inválidas" error
  - Same error for wrong email AND wrong password (no information leakage)
  - No JWT token stored on failed login
  - User stays on login page
  - Verified via Playwright browser automation
- Feature #12: Logout works end-to-end
  - "Cerrar sesión" button in sidebar triggers logout
  - JWT token cleared from localStorage
  - User redirected to /login
  - Accessing protected routes after logout redirects to /login
  - Verified via Playwright test script
- Feature #14: JWT session persists across page refreshes
  - Token persists in localStorage across F5/reload
  - AuthContext useEffect checks token on mount, calls /auth/me to restore user
  - User info (name, role) displays correctly after refresh
  - No console errors, no redirect to login
  - Even works across multiple refreshes
  - Verified via Playwright test script
